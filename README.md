## Getting Started
* clone this repo
* npm install
* npm start

## Reflection

I started by using  the `create-react-app` boilerplate. I used `redux` in order to centralized the application state.      

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Redux, CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - The front framework.
* [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) - Predictable state container for JavaScript web apps.

## Authors

* **Roy Stern** - *Initial work*
